# Damnation
### Blessing of Salvation management for tanks
A lightweight addon that removes Blessing of Salvation automatically and other unnecessary buffs for tanking.Â Clearing Blessing of Salvation manually, especially from Paladins who do not announce it, can drive one insane and can make tanking miserable.

## Features

### Three operating modes
- **Always:** Always remove Blessing of Salvation (or other unwanted buffs)
- **When Tanking:** Remove Blessing of Salvation (or other unwanted buffs) only when tanking (Warriors in Defensive Stance, Druids in Bear Form, Paladins with Righteous Fury)
- **Never:** Never remove Blessing of Salvation (or other unwanted buffs)

### Announcements
You can toggle announcing when Damnation removes Blessing of Salvation (or other unwanted buffs).

### Remove Other Unwanted Buffs
Additional unwanted buffs can also be removed. Check user interface options for more details.

### Profiles
You can setup as many profiles as you want and easily setup a different profile per character or per class.

### Slash Commands
Slash commands are supported. Type `/dmn` or `/damnation` for help about slash command options.

## Important Note
Unfortunately, Blizzard disallow addons from removing buffs while player is in combat. However, Damnation will remove Blessing of Salvation (and other unwanted buffs) as soon as player leave combat.
